## Adding local packages

> [Official doc](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path)

Imagine you've a tree structure like this:

```text
c:\christophe\repositories\
    |-- pandoc                  your package
        |-- composer.json           "name": "avonture/pandoc"
    |-- marknotes               your project
        |-- composer.json
```

The `pandoc` package defined a package called `avonture/pandoc` and you wish to use it in the `marknotes` project.

**So, in short, you want to use a local package in your project.**

In your project `marknotes\composer.json` file, change two settings:

1. In the list of repositories, add a `path` entry and set the `url` to the relative path to the package so:

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../pandoc/"
    }
  ]
```

2. Then add your package in the `require` list like this:

```json
  "require": {
    "avonture/pandoc": "dev-master"
  }
```

Now, run a `composer install` to install that new package in your project.

Curious? Go to your project, navigate in the `vendor` folder and you'll see that the package is a *NTFS junction* (similar to a symbolic link) to your local package. We can force a symlink like below but, then, `composer install` should be started from a DOS Prompt under Admin privileges.

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../pandoc/",
      "options": {
        "symlink": true
      }
    }
  ]
```

Nice thing: any changes in your package is therefore immediately done in your project. **Really handy when you develop the package and the project that uses it at the same time.**

<!-- below, content of ./010-tips/update-dev-install-prod/index.md -->

### Update on dev, install on prod

On the production server, to make sure to install exactly the same dependencies than on your last dev installation, prefer to use `composer install`. Composer will then install the same version as defined in the `composer.lock` file and not, like with `composer update` the last available version for all your dependencies.

To make sure your `composer.lock` file is up-to-date before going to production, run a `composer validate` so `composer.lock` is refreshed.

`composer install` will retrieve version information's from `composer.lock`.

<!-- below, content of ./030-tools/index.md -->

## Tools

<!-- below, content of ./030-tools/security-scanner/index.md -->

### Security scanner

Online tool, scan the `composer.lock` file, get the list of used dependencies and detect if somes of them have vulnerabilities.

<!-- below, content of ./090-troubleshooting/index.md -->

## Troubleshooting

<!-- below, content of ./090-troubleshooting/composer-is-slow/index.md -->

### Composer is slow

#### Things to do

##### Make sure to use the latest version of Composer

> [https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#self-update-selfupdate-](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#self-update-selfupdate-)

Don't use an old version, upgrade your current version of Composer by running

```bash
composer self-update
```

##### Disable xDebug

> [https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#xdebug-impact-on-composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#xdebug-impact-on-composer)

When xDebug is enabled on CLI, composer will run in a non-optimized way.

To detect if xDebug is enable, run `php -m | findstr xdebug` on the command prompt. If you don't see `xdebug` as the result of the command, it means that the xDebug module isn't loaded and this is fine.

##### Use https instead http

Prefer `https://packagist.org` on `http`. Run the next statement and make sure you're using the secured protocol:

```bash
composer config --editor --global
```

##### Install prestissimo

> [https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo)

Once installed, `Prestissimo` will start during any `composer install` or `composer update` statement and will download, in parallel, any needed librairies. This done, composer will start to make his job; loading everything from the cache.

`Prestissimo` will thus speed up the process of downloading packages.

```bash
composer global require hirak/prestissimo
```

* Make sure curl is loaded in your `php.ini` (run `php --ini` to determine the full path of that file),
* If you get the `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate:` when running `composer update` (see https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/6855):
   * Download the `cacert.pem` file from [https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem),
   * Save the file on your disk (`C:\Composer\cacert.pem` f.i.),
   * With your File Explorer, right-click on the download file and make sure the file isn't blocked,
   * Edit `php.ini` and add `curl.cainfo = "C:\Composer\cacert.pem"`,
   * Restart your apache server (optional for CLI scripts)

#### Update only the required library

If you wish to only update one library, just run the following command:

```bash
composer update vendor/package --with-dependencies
```

#### Get more informations

Here is how to detect the slowest part of the update action.

* `-vvv`: Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
* `--profile`: Display timing and memory usage information

```bash
composer update -vvv --profile
```

The output of such statement will looks like below and will allow to detect bottlenecks.

composer diagnose

### Display the config

Display the list of configuration options of Composer.

```bash
composer config --list

In the output, make sure that:

* `repositories.packagist.org.url`: make sure you're using `https`. If not, you can force it by running `composer config --global repo.packagist composer https://packagist.org`
* `github-protocols`: we can force `https` and avoid timeout f.i. if `ssh` can't be used on your network. Force `https` by running `composer config --global github-protocols https` (note: seems to be only for `GitHub.com`)

### mbstring

The error below is like the [openssl one](#openssl-extension-is-required). The extension to enable is `mbstring`.

```bash
the requested PHP extension mbstring is missing from your system
```

<!-- below, content of ./090-troubleshooting/openssl/index.md -->

### openssl extension is required

If you get the following error when f.i. running a `composer update`, just think to enable the `openssl` extension in your `php.ini`.

```bash
[Composer\Exception\NoSslException]
  The openssl extension is required for SSL/TLS protection but is not available. If you can not enable the openssl ex
  tension, you can disable this error, at your own risk, by setting the 'disable-tls' option to true.
```

Under Dos, run `php --info | more` and pay attention to the `Loaded Configuration File` configuration item. You'll see there the name of the loaded `php.ini`.

Open that file with Notepad, search for the `extension=openssl` line and remove the `;` at the first position.

Save and close.
