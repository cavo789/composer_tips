## Adding local packages

> [Official doc](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path)

Imagine you've a tree structure like this:

```text
c:\christophe\repositories\
    |-- pandoc                  your package
        |-- composer.json           "name": "avonture/pandoc"
    |-- marknotes               your project
        |-- composer.json
```

The `pandoc` package defined a package called `avonture/pandoc` and you wish to use it in the `marknotes` project.

**So, in short, you want to use a local package in your project.**

In your project `marknotes\composer.json` file, change two settings:

1. In the list of repositories, add a `path` entry and set the `url` to the relative path to the package so:

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../pandoc/"
    }
  ]
```

2. Then add your package in the `require` list like this:

```json
  "require": {
    "avonture/pandoc": "dev-master"
  }
```

Now, run a `composer install` to install that new package in your project. 

Curious? Go to your project, navigate in the `vendor` folder and you'll see that the package is a *NTFS junction* (similar to a symbolic link) to your local package. We can force a symlink like below but, then, `composer install` should be started from a DOS Prompt under Admin privileges.

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../pandoc/",
      "options": {
        "symlink": true
      }
    }
  ]
```

Nice thing: any changes in your package is therefore immediately done in your project. **Really handy when you develop the package and the project that uses it at the same time.**

## Troubleshooting

### Self-update

Make sure you're using the latest version of Composer.

```bash
composer self-update
```

### Config

Display the list of configuration options of Composer.

```bash
composer config --list
```

In the output, make sure that:

* `repositories.packagist.org.url`: make sure you're using `https`. If not, you can force it by running `composer config --global repo.packagist composer https://packagist.org`
* `github-protocols`: we can force `https` and avoid timeout f.i. if `ssh` can't be used on your network. Force `https` by running `composer config --global github-protocols https` (note: seems to be only for `GitHub.com`)

### Diagnose

Checks common errors to help debugging problems ([official doc](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#diagnose))

```bash
composer diagnose
```

### Composer is slow

#### Disable Xdebug

When Xdebug is enabled on CLI, composer will run in a non-optimized way.

To detect if Xdebug is enable, run `php -m | findstr xdebug` on the command prompt. If you don't see `xdebug` as the result of the command, it means that the xdebug module isn't loaded and this is fine.

#### Get more informations

Here is how to detect the slowest part of the update action.

* `-vvv`: Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
* `--profile`: Display timing and memory usage information

```bash
composer update -vvv --profile
```

The output of such statement will looks like below and will allow to detect bottlenecks.
